# Biochar
+ Immediate increase in C storage
+ Long lasting effect on C storage (>100 yrs)
+ One time application $\rightarrow$ not restricted to surface soil
+ Variable organic feedstocks (wood, stover, green cut, ...)
+ High demand, High value $\rightarrow$ Up-scaling is hard, demand much higher than supply
+ ~={red}**Is NOT inert:**=~
	+ Can leach
	+ Can interact with microbes and minerals
	+ Can weather and break down
	+ General chemical and physical breakdown
	+ 10% Decomposition / year
+ ~={green}**Co-Benefits:**=~
	+ Increase soil pH
	+ Increase water and nutrient retention
	+ Lowers bulk density and N losses
	+ Improved soil structure
	+ Good habitat for soil microbes
+ ~={blue}**Other Benefits:**=~
	+ Water pollution clean up
	+ Making concrete more environmentally friendly
	+ PFAS cleanup
## Biochar in Nebraska
+ We have a problem with Eastern Red Cedar
+ Use it to make biochar locally!
+ **Blue Heron Tiospaye:** Local indigenous non-profit that hosted a workshop where they chopped down Eastern Red Cedar and made biochar using a homemade kiln. 

## ENREEC & SCAL Biochar Experiment:
+ Corn Soy Rotation
+ 28 tons/acre | 70 tons/ha
+ Used sub plots of other established field experiments to test the effects of biochar on various other management practices:
	+ Cover Crop vs Non Cover Crop
	+ Rain fed vs Irrigated
+ ~={green}**Results**=~
	+ Biochar increased the ~={blue}Carbon Stock=~ by over double in almost all cases
	+ Cover crop in rain fed system was the only system that the added C was fully recoverable
		+ Irrigation was not the main factor, but the irrigated subplots were more susceptible to ~={red}wind erosion=~
	+ ~={blue}Nitrate retention=~ in the topsoil was also doubled
	+ **There is some interaction between biochar and iron. Iron oxides (Fe(III)) needs to form on the biochar to retain nitrates and phosphates.**
## Other Kaiser Experiment
+ Near Lincoln Waste Water facility, June 2023
+ **Treatments:** cover cropped and no-till $\rightarrow$ Biochar, Biosolids, Biochar + Biosolids, Control
	+ Plots with biosolids were not treated with mineral fertilizer
	+ Plots with only biochar did receive mineral fertilizer
+ 4 replicates per treatment, 1 rep = 1 acre
+ 16 acres in total $\rightarrow$ one of the largest field experiments in the US
+ ~={green}**Results**:=~
	+ C recovery rate was 100%
	+ N, P, K retention increased
		+ Most in biochar + biosolids

## Field Analyses of Biochar 
### **Germany Field Experiment**
+ Field experiments in NW and SE Germany
+ Sand or Sandy Loam soils
+ Conventional Management
+ Biochar disked in (tillage)
+ Took samples 4 & 6 years after establishment
+ Treatments:
	+ **Northwest:** Mineral vs Natural Fertilizer & 3 vs 40 tons/ha biochar 
	+ **Southeast**: 20 vs 70 tons/ha compost + 9 vs 31 tons/ha biochar
+ ~={green}**Results:**=~
	+ **Southeast Bulk Measurements:**
		+ Bulk density decrease
		+ Biochar did not increase sandy C stocks significantly
		+ No change in CEC or pH
	+ **Southeast Fractional Measurements:**
		+ Large increase in <0.053 mm (MAOM) in SE
		+ Other increases (see slides)
+ ~={blue}**Management Recommendations:**=~
	+ May need higher applications than previously thought (>30 tons/ha)
	+ High biochar rates showed good effects on OC storage across different fractions

### Global Biochar Meta-Analysis
+ Biochar increased SOC stock by 29% on average ($\ce{Mg ha^{-1}}$)
+ Biochar increased SOC by 75% ($\ce{g kg^{-1}}$)

### Meta-Analyses
+ Reducing heavy metals in plants
+ All the other benefits we have talked about show up
+ Irrigated systems tended to increase effect on SOC
+ Returning crop residues also helps
+ Showing long term benefits (Higher storage after 6-20 years after additions vs 1-5 years)
+ Irrigation helped biochar SOC effects in drier climates, but can get iffy in hotter climates (warm + wet = decompose)

## Greenhouse Gas Mitigation
+ Restoring cultivated wetlands is the most expensive but most effective ($\ce{1200 Mt CO2-eq yr^{-1} / \$100mil}$)
	+ Only able to do in areas that were previously wetland
+ Biochar can be used in a lot of places but is much less efficient per area at sequestering C

# Soil C dynamics and Land Use Change
+ Switching grassland to cropland $\rightarrow$ only takes ~={red}**50 years**=~ to lose all of the C and achieve new steady state.
+ Cropland to Forest/Grassland $\rightarrow$ ~={red}**Over 100 years to get back to original SOC steady state**=~
+ Exchangeable Calcium was the main driving factor in returning carbon after land use change
+ Grassland soils have higher microbial biomass, especially in subsoil
	+ More food via grass roots
	+ Possibly higher and deeper infiltration as well
+ I kinda lost the plot during this section so I probably missed some key takeaways

# Nitrogen

## Global N Pools

## Nitrogen Cycle
+ Complicated because N can take up many different forms and oxidation states
+ **Atmospheric N2 $\rightarrow$**
	+ Industrial N fixation (Haber-Bosch) $\rightarrow$ Fertilizer
	+ Biological N fixation
	+ Atmospheric Precipitation 
+ See slides for full diagram of N cycle
## Why is Soil N Cycle so Dynamic?
+ Required in large amounts by plants and microbes
+ Most of the soil N is in organic form
+ Transformations are mediated by microorganisms
+ Many oxidation states:
	+ $\ce{NO3^- (+5)}$
	+ $\ce{NO2^- (+3)}$
	+ $\ce{N2 (0)}$
	+ $\ce{NH3 (-3)}$
	+ $\ce{NH4^+ (-3)}$
+ Many forms:
	+ see slides

## Biological N fixation
+ Increases N availability to host plants
+ decreases pH
# Quotes of the Day
> "The effect was mainly due to wind erosion. We were applying the biochar and there was a black cloud over the field. We thought 'Oh that's maybe not good'".
> "Again, I am all in on no-till and cover cropping. Showing that C stocks increase more under conventional management and biochar additions does not mean I want to recommend erosion"
> "It is very easy to break a window, right? It takes much longer to create a window. Soil Carbon is the same."
