## Thermodynamics
+ Demonstrations (interrelation of head and work with chemical reactions or with physical changes of state)
+ All spontaneous
+ Why are some changes spontaneous?
	+ **Chemical Perspective**: Changes are spontaneous if the system being observed proceeds from **higher to lower energy states**
	+ ~={red}Not a complete definition, but OK for now.=~
+ Questions addressed by thermodynamics:
	+ Why does a system change?
	+ What is the direction of a change?
+ Parts of thermodynamics are related
	+ Chemical equilibrium
	+ Energies of processes
### Chemical Equilibria
+ **Criteria?**
	+ No change in net composition of system
	+ System is closed (No exchange of components or energy)
+ **Can soil processes ever meet these criteria??**
	+ No absolutely not
	+ We need a way to quantify equilibria
+ **Equilibrium constants!**
	+ $\ce{aA + bB = cC + dD}$
	+ $K^o = \dfrac{C^cD^d}{A^aB^b}$
		+ where A, B, etc. are **activities** of the system components at equilibrium,
		+ a, b, etc. are stoichiometric coefficients, and
		+ $K^o$ is the equilibrium constant
+ **Why use $K^o$?**
	+ Predict system composition at equilibrium
	+ Suppose we have $K^o$ from some source (it is a true constant), and know all system component activities except one (B)...
	+ $\ce{bB} = \dfrac{C^cD^d}{A^aK^o}$
	+ Could make our lives easier, for example if B is too hard or dangerous to measure directly
### Energies of Reactions
+ Systems want to change to reach lowest possible energy state
+ In doing so, give off energy to surroundings
	+ **Sensible energies**: Release heat (Exothermic reactions), absorb heat (Endothermic reactions)
+ **Standard state of Enthalpy**
	+ $\ce{H}$ is enthalpy
	+ $\ce{\Delta H}$ is a change in enthalpy
	+ $\ce{\Delta H^o}$ is a change in enthalpy at standard temperature and pressure (STP)
	+ $\ce{\Delta H^o_r}$ is heat energy (cal, J) lost in a specific reaction per mole of substance at STP
	+ Negative values of $\ce{\Delta H^o_r}$ are exothermic reactions, while positive values are endothermic
+ **Gibbs Free Energy of Reaction**
	+ $\ce{\Delta G^o_r}$ (Delta G naught sub r)
	+ Negative values of $\ce{\Delta G^o_r}$ indicates lower energy of products than reactants, energy releasing, so thermodynamically-favorable reaction.
		+ **Note:** changes in terms $\rightarrow$ releases heat to releases energy, spontaneous to thermodynamically-favorable
+ **If $\ce{\Delta G^o_r} \ne \ce{\Delta H^o_r}$, then what is missing?**
	+ $\ce{\Delta S^o_r}$ (Entropy state of reaction at STP)
	+ Entropy is a measure of system disorder
		+ Systems like to become "more disordered"
	+ **Positive** $\ce{\Delta S^o_r}$ indicates that reaction is favored
		+ Opposite to Enthalpy and Free Energy
+ **Summary**
+ For a ~={orange}thermodynamically-favored=~ reaction
	+ $\ce{\Delta H^o_r}$ is *usually* negative
	+ $\ce{\Delta S^o_r}$ is *usually* positive
	+ $\ce{\Delta G^o_r}$ is ***ALWAYS*** negative
