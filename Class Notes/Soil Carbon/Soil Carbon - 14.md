+ (Llado et al., 2017) -> Very nice homogenized P, C, N cycle diagram

## Biological N Fixation
+ **Species in the US**:
	+ Bradyrhizobium Japonicum
	+ Bradyrhizobium Elkanii
+ Bacteria attach to soybean roots in response to attractants exuded by roots, mainly **flavanoids**
+ Bacteria-to-plant signal molecules or Nod factors cause soybeans to respond by root hair curling or deformation and eventually resulting in complete nodule structure
+ This process is sensitive to abiotic stresses (pH, salinity, etc.)
