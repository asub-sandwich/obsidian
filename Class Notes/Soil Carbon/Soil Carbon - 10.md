# Functions of Soil Organic Matter
+ Provides substrate for microbes
	+ Microbes decomposing OM releases nutrients from soil minerals
+ Provides glue for soil structure
	+ Better infiltration and aeration
	+ Less erosion
	+ Greater water holding capacity
	+ Aggregate stability increases linearly with SOM
	+ Bulk density decreases inversely with SOM
+ Increasing Nutrient Retention and CEC 
	+ Only source of nutrients in sandy soils or [[Oxisols|oxisols]]/ferrosols
+ Buffers soil pH
+ Binds pollutants
+ Stores greenhouse gasses
+ **Most critical for sustainable and resource efficient soil productivity**

# Nebraska Extension: Soil Management for Increased Soil Organic Matter
+ SOM in NE follows a general climatic pattern, with higher precipitation == higher SOM
+ Glacial Till PM also seems to have higher SOM for same precipitation compared to non-glaciated areas
# Improvement & maintenance of SOM content
+ [[#Tillage and Aggregates]]
+ [[#Application of Manure & Compost]]
+ [[#Winter Cover Crops]]
+ [[#Erosion Control]]
+ [[#Biochar]]

## Tillage and Aggregates
+ Tillage destroys aggregates
+ Reduced tillage leads to higher SOC
+ Destruction of aggregates leads to exposure of oPOM, which can then be decomposed and respired
+ Effects of conventional tillage on SOC is only seen in upper 10cm, in fact, tilled soils usually contain MORE carbon below 15cm until somewhere near plow depth due to mechanical mixing and then subsequent DOC leaching and bioturbation
+ See slides for meta-analyses on Conventional/Reduced/NoTill
	+ Potential benefits of decreasing tillage intensity with respect to soil functions that are closely related to organic matter need to be separated into appropriate depths.
+ <strong><span style="color:#DD4444">Win-Win System:</span></strong> Less work for farmer and there are clear benefits to the soil

## Application of Manure & Compost
+ **Manuring**
+ Long-term Rothamsted (1840-Present) study. Farmyard Manure increased concentration of Bulk C (when constantly added)
+ NPK did not increased C compared to no fertilizer
+ Manured soils C levels returned to unfertilized quickly after manuring stopped (within 50 years) 
	+ remained about 10% above no-fertilization at present
+ Losses:
	+ Main: Microbial decomposition
	+ Less: Erosion and DOC leaching
+ Manure is not well defined, contains many sources and combinations of waste
+ Meta-analyses have revealed that across board, manuring increases SOC, but extremely variable responses depending on type
+ Amount of manure applied seems to be inversely related to SOC response
+ Combination of chemical fertilizer & manure resulted in biggest $\Delta\text{SOC}$ ($\text{g kg}^{-1}$) compared to Chem+Straw, Straw, and unbalanced Chem

+ **Composting**
+ Meta-analyses show that residue returning increases SOC across the board by about 10%
	+ Irrigated systems are an outlier, as high water (and hotter climates that usually need irrigation) increases respiration and decomposition
		+ Causes very low increases in SOC
	+ No Nitrogen fertilization systems are also an outlier, with very high increases in SOC
		+ Nitrogen is limiting factor, microbes also cannot use it and therefore go dormant and decomposition goes down immensely
	+ 
## Winter Cover Crops
+ **fPOM**: should increase because of above- and below-ground litter
+ **oPOM**: should increase as roots serve as aggregation nuclei
+ **MAOM**: should increase because of higher microbial biomass, EPS, and rhizodeposits
	+ activity should be higher as winter cover crops should also increase infiltration and temperature in winter soils, increasing microbial activity
+ <strong><span style="color:#DD4444">NOT A WIN-WIN</span></strong> While you don't have fallow, erosion should decrease, and carbon should increase:
	+ It is more work for the farmers
	+ Studies are not as clear on SOC increase compared to manuring or notill
	+ New studies are showing large increases in MAOM in temperate climates in surface soils
	+ It is expensive, seed is expensive and operating machinery is expensive
+ Blanco (UNL-Agron): Cover crop meta-analysis in US
	+ Cover crops increase soil C in only 29% of comparisons of cover vs no cover
	+ Cover crops may not incrase soil C if they produce $\text{<2 Mg ha}^{-1}$ of biomass
	+ Cover crops increase soil C the mose in low C soils (<1%C) and after 5 yrs
	+ Early planting and late termination can boost biomass C input from cover crops
	+ Overall, cover crops may accumulate soil C only in 1/3 of cases based on US studies

## Erosion Control
+ W Hillslope Processes
	+ Shoulder, Backslope $\rightarrow$ Sources
	+ Footslope, Depression $\rightarrow$ Sinks
+ **Methods of Erosion Control**
	1. Leaving Residue
	2. No / Reduced Tillage
	3. Contour Tillage
	4. Grass Waterways
	5. Prairie Strips
	6. Terraces
	7. Windrows (Trees)

## Biochar
+ Obtained by burning organic material in oxygen-limited environments
+ Biochar is 80% C
+ Biochar amendments are a direct injection which results in an immediate measurable increase in SOC
+ Long lasting effect on soil C
	+ Microbes do not decompose biochar while there is any other substrate for microbes
	+ Does provide pore space for microbes to hang out
	+ Theory: 90% of biochar carbon is stable for >100 years
	+ Studies: Still 50% of biochar carbon is stable, but we do not know where the rest is going
+ Can be applied only once to still see effects
	+ Repeat applications still recommended: Once/generation or thereabouts
	+ Have to till it into the soil to protect against erosion however
	+ Benefits only come about when it is mixed and can react with other OM and minerals
+ Different feedstocks for biochar can have different effects
+ Improvement of soil fertility and crop yield
+ Increase soil pH
+ Improved soil structure
+ Lowers bulk density and N losses
+ Long-term biochar use may reduce the need for N fertilizer
	+ Better for environment
	+ Saves farmers money
+ Biochar adsorbs non-pyrolyzed OM (root C)
	+ Does not hit the same SOC plateau that litter, residue, and manure experience
+ <span style="color:#DD4444">Improvements largely dependent on feedstock and pyrolysis temperature</span>

### *Terra Preta* soils
+ 8,000 years ago: indigenous people were mixing in additions into their agricultural soil, often this included some form of biochar (as waste)
	+ Charcoal fragments
	+ Charcoal powder
	+ Pot shards
	+ Bones
	+ Animal feces
+ The results are still fertile, incredibly OM rich soils that are nearly adjacent to infertile, non-black soils
+ Even soils that have not been amended in thousands of years still have statistically significant increased SOC compared to adjacent soils


# Take Home Messages
+ [[#Tillage and Aggregates|Reduced or No-Till]] is easy to implement and increases SOC across the board ONLY IN THE UPPER MOST DEPTH OF TOPSOIL
+ [[#Application of Manure & Compost]] increases SOC, is less dependent on site conditions, but complicated due to definitions and variation among methods
+ Fertilization increases SOC because fertilization leads to higher yield $\rightarrow$ higher biomass $\rightarrow$ higher SOC
+ [[#Winter Cover Crops]] increases SOC more or less depending on climate and parent material, but is expensive and laborious
+ [[#Erosion Control]] retains SOC in sloped uplands, but usually spoken about in other areas such as pollution management
+ [[#Biochar]]
