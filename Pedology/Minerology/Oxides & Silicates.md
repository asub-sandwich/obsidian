# Oxides
- Oxides are abundant chemicals in soil
- They have relatively simple chemical formulae and crystal structure
- Mainly formed during the weathering of primary minerals that contain iron and aluminum
- **Three main forms**:
	- Oxides: Metal + Oxygen i.e. $\ce{Fe2O3}$
	- Hydroxides: Metal + Hydroxide i.e. $\ce{Al(OH)3}$
	- Oxyhydroxides: Metal + Oxygen + Hydroxide i.e. $\ce{FeO(OH)}$

## Aluminum Oxides

Mineral   | Formula               | Soil Environment | Crystal Shape 
----------|-----------------------|------------|---------------
[[#Gibbsite]]  | $\ce{\gamma-Al(OH)3}$ | Most common Al-oxide in soils and bauxite deposits | Pseudohexagonal Plates (or rods)
Am. Al-Ox | $\ce{Al(OH)3(am)}$    | Common in soils; intermediate in the formation of gibbsite | Amorphous
Bayerite  | $\ce{\alpha-Al(OH)3}$ | Uncommon in soils; common in bauxite deposits | Triangular Pyramids
[[#Boehmite & Diaspore]] | $\ce{\gamma/\alpha-AlOOH}$   | Not common in soils; occurs in bauxite deposits | Tiny particles

### Gibbsite
- Sometimes referred to as hydrargillite
- Gibbsite neoformation is promoted by high rainfall in freely drained soils and by warm weather
	- Crystalline gibbsite is most common in tropical soils
	- Poorly crystalline aluminum hydroxide is more common in less weathered soils
	- Lots of gibbsite in temperate settings may indicate that the soil is old

### Boehmite & Diaspore
- Mainly occur in highly weathered soils ( [[Oxisols|oxisols]])

## Iron Oxides

- Iron oxides are more abundant in soils than aluminum oxides

Mineral | Formula | Soil Environment | Crystal Shape | Maximum Al substitution 
-|-|-|-|-
[[#Goethite]] | $\ce{\alpha-FeO(OH)}$ | Most common Fe-oxide in soils | Irregular in soils; needles & laths when synthesized | One-third of $\ce{Fe^3+}$ may be substituted
[[#Lepidocrocite]] | $\ce{\gamma-FeO(OH)}$ | Poorly drained noncalcareous soils | Laths | Little
[[#Ferrihydrite]] | $\ce{5 Fe2O3 * 9 H2O}$ | Precursor to hematite; formed when $\ce{Fe^2+}$ is rapidly oxidized in the presence of OM or silicates | Spherical; Aggregated | Unknown
[[#Hematite]] | $\ce{\alpha-Fe2O3}$ | Highly weathered soils | Irregular | Up to one-sixth of $\ce{Fe^3+}$ may be substituted
Magnetite | $\ce{Fe3O4}$ | Primary mineral that persists in coarse grains; Contains $\ce{Fe^2+, Fe^3+}$ | Cubes | Possible
Maghemite | $\ce{\gamma-Fe2O3}$ | Formed from magnetite by oxidation of $\ce{Fe2+}$; may form under burning vegetation | Cubes | Possible

### Goethite
- Can be found in a wide variety of soils
	- Temperate to Tropical
	- Semiarid to Humid
- Brownish-yellowish color
- Double chains of Fe-O octahedra that share corners or edges
- Staggered double chains with H bonds between O and OH of neighboring octahedra that do not share O atoms
- Honeycomb-esque shape

### Lepidocrocite
- Polymorph of goethite
- Double chains of Fe octahedra form zigzag sheets, with H bonding between the sheets
- Flat sheets
- Bright orange in color
	- Typically found in concentrations or mottles ([[Redox]] features)

### Hematite
- Forms in strongly weathered soils or can be inherited from the parent material
- Deep red color

### Ferrihydrite
- Poorly-crystalline & fine-grained
- Reddish-brown: Intermediate between [[#Goethite]] & [[#Hematite]]
- Found in [[Bogs|bogs]] and [[Spodic Horizon|spodic horizons]]
