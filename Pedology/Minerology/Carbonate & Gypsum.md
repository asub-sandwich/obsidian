# Carbonates
- Content of $\ce{CaCO3}$ is used to define carbonatic, particle size, calcareous soil classes, and calcic and petrocalcic horizons

# Gypsum

## Terminology
- **Gypseous**: Soils whose primary constituent is gypsum
- **Gypsiferous**: Soils whose primary constituent is not gypsum, but instead parent sediment.
- **Gypsum Soils**: Soils that fit the definition of gypseous and gypsiferous

## 1. The Gypsum System 
### 1.1 Occurrence with $\ce{CaCO3}$
**Common ion effect**: When a system contains both $\ce{CaSO4*2 H2O}$ and $\ce{CaCO3}$, the solubility of $\ce{CaCO3}$ will be significantly lower because gypsum has the higher solubility
- Any dissolving ability will dissolve gypsum first, which will increase $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$ in the system, causing the equilibrium carbonate dissolution to remain strongly on the precipitation side

## 2. Primary Factors in Formation of Gypsum soils
- Gypsum can be transported in 3 ways (or a combination of the 3)
	- Solution: Chemical process
	- Suspension: Physical process (only when carrying waters are saturated with gypsum)
	- Mass Movement (uncommon): Physical Process
- "Nevertheless, the question still remains without documentation for or against illuviated gypsum."
- Using Simonson's soil forming factors, transfers and translocations of gypsum would involve movement in dissolved or suspended phases.
	- Transformation, however, should work similarly to pedogenic carbonates forming in limestone residuum, but we literally don't know. 

### 2.1 Parent Material
- Parent material controls gypsum soils formation in areas of reduced precipitation, minimal leaching, and shallow wetting depths. 
- Parent sediments for gypsum soils cover a wide range of depositional environments, textures, and minerologies.
- Pedogenic Gypsum sources:
	- Rock Gypsum
	- Alluvial sediments weathered from rock gypsum
	- Gypsum-rich lacustrine deposits
	- Aeolian deposits derived from weathered gypsum crystals
	- Gypsum-rich coastal precipitates
- Gypsum soils in the American Southwest are often in parent materials that were not originally high in gypsum.
### 2.2 Climate
- Gypsum soils are rare in udic moisture regimes, as it is easily leached in humid or wet conditions
	- Gypsum rock outcrops are also not generally present in these climates
- Temperature has less of an effect than moisture, especially when soils are forming in gypsum rock residuum.

## 3. Gypsum Soil Landscapes
- Landscape evolution and soil age with respect to $\ce{CaCO3}$ are well studied, this cannot be said for gypsum. 
- **Open questions related to gypsum soil-landscape formation**:
	- What are the ages of geomorphic surfaces associated with gypsic and petrogypsic horizons?
	- How might they compare to calcic and petrocalcic horizons?
	- Is formation of a petrogypsic horizon and indication of landscape stability over time (as a petrocalcic is)?
	- Of what importance is karst development on gypseous soil landscapes?
	- What landforms or positions on landforms are associated with gypsic and petrogypsic horizons in both gypsiferous and gypseous soils?
	- Do pedogenic gypsum horizons have morphologies that depend on texture of the parent material, soil age, and geomorphic history of the soil landscape in a manner similar to pedogenic calcium carbonate as presented in [Gile et al. (1966)](https://doi.org/10.1097/00010694-196605000-00001) ?

### 3.1 Stages of Pedogenic Gypsum Accumulation
- Since carbonate stages are well researched and defined, it is reasonable to assume that the same would be so for gypsum and silica stages.
	- This is highly questionable, as none of the three are completely analogous, and the solubility differences between the three might indicate that gypsum has more transient stages
- Vermiform gypsum is often misidentified as calcium carbonate, especially in systems where calcium carbonate presence is confirmed via effervescence. 

### 3.2 Gypsiferous Soil Landscapes
- Landforms associated:
	- Basins
		- Alluvial Fans
		- Piedmonts
		- Alluvial Flats
	- Alluvial Plains
	- Coastal Plains
	- Saline Seeps

**Gypsiferous Soils in the Central US**
- Rolling Red Plains (OK, TX, KS)
	- Badlands topography
	- Red bed, Permian aged rock that include rock gypsum in the Blaine formation and gypsiferous shales in the Flowerpot Shale.
	- Ustic moisture regime
	- **Gypsic Calciustolls** often form in loamy alluvium on stream terraces, with a depth to gypsum bedrock greater than profile depth (150cm)
		- Gypsic horizons can range from 20%-80% gypsum by weight.
	- **Entic Haplustolls** with a depth to gypsum bedrock of 20-40 cm (but with insufficient thickness to form a gypsic horizon) form on summits, shoulders, and backslopes.
	- **Lithic Ustorthents** develop when bedrock is shallower, but in similar positions to Entic Haplustolls
