**Figure 1**
+ So Red!!!

**Figure 2**
+ A 1:1 line would have been nice for the charts that it makes sense for (sets vs mean) as well as equal coordinate graphs.
+ The replicates were very similar for all except K values of Dry soil (set vs mean)

**Table 3**
+ Is there a reason they did not use a set of correlation matrices instead of forcing the table format to be a correlation matrix

**Figure 3**
+ Again, a 1:1 line would have been nice where it makes sense

**Table 5**
+ The backwards conversion is interesting as you lose data converting CMYK or CIELab into Munsell. I wonder how what the actual values differ by, especially when there is only one chip/page discrepancy.
